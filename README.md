# Arduino Weather Station

This project is a weather station using an Arduino and various sensors to monitor environmental conditions and display data on an LCD screen(later on mobile app).

## Components
- **DHT11** - Temperature and Humidity Sensor
- **BMP280** - Barometric Pressure and Temperature Sensor
- **BH1750** - Light Intensity Sensor
- **MQ-7** - Carbon Monoxide Sensor
- **MQ-135** - Air Quality Sensor
- **GY-ML8511** - UV Sensor
- **Rain Sensor** - Detects rainfall
- **RTC Module** - Real-Time Clock for displaying current time
- **1602 LCD** - Displays sensor data

## Features
- Measures and displays temperature, humidity, pressure, light intensity, air quality, UV index, and rainfall.
- Shows real-time clock information.
- Displays all data on a 1602 LCD.

## Setup
1. Connect the sensors and LCD to the Arduino according to their pin configurations.
2. Upload the code to the Arduino.
3. Observe live environmental data on the LCD.
