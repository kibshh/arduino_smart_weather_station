 * 2. Checks the status of a device at a specific 7-bit address (1â€“127).
 * 
 * @param device_address Address to check or `I2C_SCAN_MODE_SCAN_FOR_ALL_DEVICES` for a full scan.
 * 
 * @return i2c_scan_return_ts
 *         - `i2c_scan_reading`: Contains detected devices or single device status.
 *         - `error_code`: Indicates success or specific errors.
 * 
 * @note Ensure the I2C bus is initialized before calling.
