  cd arduino_smart_weather_station
  ```

### 2. Set Upstream Remote
- Add the upstream repository to keep your fork up-to-date:
  ```bash
  git remote add upstream git@github.com:kibshh/arduino_smart_weather_station.git

### 3. Create a Branch
- Always create a new branch for your work:
  ```bash
  git checkout -b feature-or-bugfix-name
  ```

### 4. Make Your Changes
- Write clean, readable, and well-documented code.
- Ensure your code follows the projectâ€™s coding standards.

### 5. Test Your Changes
- Thoroughly test your changes to confirm they work as intended.
- If you don't own an Arduino or the necessary sensors/parts, please add a comment to your related Trello card or in the PR so someone else can test your changes.

### 6. Commit Your Changes
- Use [Semantic Commit Messages](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for your commits. Examples:
  - `feat(sensor): add support for DHT11 temperature sensor`
  - `fix(display): correct issue with incorrect humidity readings`
  - `feat: task_cyclicTask implementation for RTC`

### 7. Push Your Branch
- Push your branch to your forked repository:
  ```bash
  git push origin feature-or-bugfix-name
  ```

### 8. Submit a Pull Request
- Open a pull request (PR) from your branch to the `main` branch of the original repository.
- In the name of the PR, add your Trello card ID. With examples from before:
  - `0AGHMOJ4 - feat(sensor): add support for DHT11 temperature sensor`
  - `9IBVFYT6 - fix(display): correct issue with incorrect humidity readings`
  - `456qosgz - feat: task_cyclicTask implementation for RTC`
- The ID at the beginning is your Trello card ID. To obtain it, open your card on Trello and copy the ID that comes after `/c/` e.g. `https://trello.com/c/<your-trello-card-id>/<card-number>-<card-name>`

- Provide a clear and concise description of your changes in the PR.
